    <p>Badminton is a popular indoor racket sport where players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net,<br> aiming to land it on the opponent's side for points. It's similar to tennis, however it's more lightweight<br> (rackets,shuttlecocks). Badminton is a sport where you have to use your wrist to aim instead of moving<br> your whole arm, which is also like tennis. You can play 1v1s, and 2v2s. You serve to the person diagonal from you, and once your opponent hits it back to your side, everybody can hit the shuttlecock/play until it touches the ground. If it touches someone's floor, the other team/side gets the point.
